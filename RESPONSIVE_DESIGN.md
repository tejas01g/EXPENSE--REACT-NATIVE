# Responsive Design Implementation

## Overview

This expense tracker app has been completely redesigned to be fully responsive across all device sizes, from small phones to large tablets. The implementation uses a comprehensive responsive utilities system that automatically scales UI elements based on screen dimensions.

## Responsive Utilities System

### Core Files
- `src/utils/responsive.js` - Main responsive utilities
- All screen components updated to use responsive design

### Key Features

#### 1. Device Detection
```javascript
export const isSmallDevice = SCREEN_WIDTH < 375;
export const isMediumDevice = SCREEN_WIDTH >= 375 && SCREEN_WIDTH < 414;
export const isLargeDevice = SCREEN_WIDTH >= 414;
export const isTablet = SCREEN_WIDTH >= 768;
```

#### 2. Responsive Scaling Functions
- `scale(size)` - Scales based on screen width
- `verticalScale(size)` - Scales based on screen height
- `moderateScale(size, factor)` - Moderate scaling with custom factor

#### 3. Responsive Design Tokens
- **Font Sizes**: `fontSizes.xs` to `fontSizes['6xl']`
- **Spacing**: `spacing.xs` to `spacing['5xl']`
- **Border Radius**: `borderRadius.sm` to `borderRadius.full`
